# Smart Irrigation System using ESP32

## Overview

This project is an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System developed using ESP32, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system automates irrigation by monitoring soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and water flow, and provides a web-based interface for control.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
- Automated irrigation based on sensor data
- Remote control via a web-based interface
- Flow rate measurement for water usage tracking
- WiFi connectivity for seamless communication

## Technologies Used

- **ESP32** (Microcontroller)
- **C++** (Firmware)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Web interface)
- **ESPAsyncWebServer** (Web server handling requests)
- **DHT22 Sensor** (Temperature and humidity sensing)
- **Soil Moisture Sensors** (For soil condition monitoring)
- **Flow Sensor** (For water flow measurement)

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 Development Board
- DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- Soil Moisture Sensors (x2)
- Flow Sensor
- Relay Module for Valve Control
- 5V Power Supply
